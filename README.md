# Problem Statement
ABC Travel company provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves, and provide added value to their corporate customers. They are looking to pilot a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional valuable information to the traveler during the flight booking process. They want to enable their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute delay or not, considering the weather forecast for the departure hour.
